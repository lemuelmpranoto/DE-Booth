Ideas for video capturing and image processing
There are 3 options:
1) Capture the video and process in rpi and then send it to de1 to display in the screen(no hardware acceleration)
2) Capture the video in rpi, send it via ethernet/or parallel port communication to de1soc. Then process it in de1soc and display
3) Capture with a camera compatible with de1soc and do process and display all in de1soc.

- We should seriously consider using linux in de1soc since it gives us a file system which we can easily manage internal and external memory

-We run on 50mhz in de1soc. If we aim to have a video quality of 30 frames per second and assuming each frame is 1 MB then we need to transfer 30 mb per second. If we transfer parallel port and transfer 1 byte per cycle we can really struggle to achieve that. Therefore, we can aim for 10 fps first

-Idea from Efe. We can actually transfer images faster if we design a ethernet interface chip in fpga which runs on a higher clock speed domain than the rest of the circuit. But then it adds greater complexity for handshaking for the rest of the circuit.
